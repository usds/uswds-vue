# uswds-vue

> **IMPORTANT!** `uswds-Vue` has moved! Although not an *officially* supported project of USDS, it is being used by various people throughout the US Government. So I can continue supporting and developing this library, I have moved it to a [personal space](https://thepipster.github.io/uswds-vue). 

The documents can be found [here](https://thepipster.github.io/uswds-vue), and the Github repo [here](https://github.com/thepipster/uswds-vue).
